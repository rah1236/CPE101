In Spring Quarter of 2022, I took CPE 101 at Cal Poly SLO. 
This repo is all of my code for that class. Partly for archiving, and partly so if you're one of the poor bastards struggling
through the class, you have somehwere to go. Unless the curriculum has completely changed, in which case, oh well?

Theres some fun little projects but mostly boring ones. Feel free to waste your time looking through it all.

If you're reading this while im still a student, feel free to reach out if you have questions at rrehmatu at calpoly dot edu
